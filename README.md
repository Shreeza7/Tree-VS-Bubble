This exercise is about trees and computational efficiency. Using the tree, you are to sort the numbers, and write out the data set to an output file. The sort will take place as you read the numbers and place them in the correct locations within the tree.

a. The data part of your tree node should store the number and keep track of the
number of occurrences of the number stored; this will be how you track
duplicates.

b. While you are building the tree, you need to count the number of compares
you make.

c. After you have built the tree, you need to write out the data so that the data is
sorted from low to high.

d. You need to write the tree out using both the recursive and iterative methods.

e. At the end of the file, you need to write out your programâ€™s operating
statistics, that is, how many compares were made in creating the tree and
writing the data out.

f. Write a brute force sort and sort the same data. In your sorting program, you
are to record the number of compares during the sort. So in this program you
will read the data into a large array, do your brute force sort (a bubble sort will
work; the bubble sort is covered in many texts and in this set of notes in
chapter 11), then write the array to a file. The output of the program will be
the number of comparisons made during the sort, and the sorted numbers.
